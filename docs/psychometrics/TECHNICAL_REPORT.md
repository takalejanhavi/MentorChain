**Inference Service:**
- Production-ready Python inference wrapper
- SHAP explainability integration
- Model versioning and metadata tracking
- Caching and performance optimization

### 5. Security and Privacy

**Data Protection:**
- AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive reports
- IPFS storage with user consent
- Blockchain hash anchoring (digest only)
- GDPR-compliant data handling

**Access Control:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based permissions (student/psychologist)
- Audit logging for all assessment events
- User-controlled data sharing

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Assessment → Trait Calculation → ML Inference → Report Generation → Blockchain Storage
```

### Model Pipeline
```
Raw Responses → Feature Engineering → Scaling → Class Balancing → Stacking Ensemble → Calibrated Predictions
```

### Storage Architecture
```
MongoDB (metadata) ← → IPFS (encrypted reports) ← → Polygon (hash anchoring)
```

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for trait calculation algorithms
- Integration tests for end-to-end assessment flow
- Model performance regression tests
- Frontend component testing

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Automated model training validation
- Performance threshold enforcement
- Dataset drift detection
- Deployment safety checks

### Monitoring
- Model accuracy tracking
- Response time monitoring
- Error rate alerting
- User engagement metrics

## Limitations and Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **Dataset Size**: 3,000 synthetic samples (recommend 10,000+ real samples)
2. **Validation Study**: Requires psychometric validation with real users
3. **Cultural Bias**: Model trained on Western personality frameworks
4. **Temporal Stability**: No longitudinal validation of predictions

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Data Collection**: Partner with educational institutions for real assessment data
2. **Cross-Cultural Validation**: Adapt questions for different cultural contexts
3. **Longitudinal Study**: Track prediction accuracy over time
4. **Advanced NLP**: Implement GPT-based report generation
5. **A/B Testing**: Compare assessment versions for optimization

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Deploy to staging environment for user testing
2. Collect real user assessment data (n=1,000)
3. Retrain model with real data and validate performance
4. Conduct psychometric validation study
5. Implement advanced explainability features

## Conclusion

The psychometric assessment integration successfully achieves the target of ≥90% accuracy while maintaining production-quality standards.
